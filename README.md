Plugin for Dalamud, LazyGatherer allow you to determine a maximized yield rotation for your gatherer, based on your level and GP.

### Roadmap

- [ ] Add option to display min/max yield instead of expected yield
- [ ] Add option to set max GP to use

Feel free to ask feature or report bug in the issue section.

### Know issues

- During revisit, may use remaining GP instead of max GP to calculate rotation  
  - If it happens, toggle the 'One turn rotation' option to force a recalculation
